/* 
Your task is to create an automated version of the card game WAR. 
There are two players. Nothing special for a tie in a round
Consider classes for Card, Deck, Player as well as properties and methods they include

The completed game should:
1. Deal 26 Cards to each Player from a Deck of 52 cards.
2. Iterate through the turns where each Player plays a Card.
3. The Player who played the higher card is awarded a point.
    - Ties result in zero points for both Players.
4. After all cards have been played, display the score and declare the winner.
